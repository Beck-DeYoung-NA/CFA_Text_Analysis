10000009,Performance decisions,27,,,,,,,,,
10000011,REF,99,,,,,,,,,
10000013,Which systems to use - Seems like we have multiply systems that perform the same function,6,,,,,,,,,
10000015,"The program we use to pick is very limited in its abilities and is causing productivity losses during the picking process, such as causing unneeded congestion and not allowing team members to do tasks that would help keep inventory in line and maintain output.",53,,,,,,,,,
10000016,Communication within the business - CFA Supply can do a better job of communicating changes that are being made and that are on the horizon within the business. This can be a struggle as we grow but communication is vitally important.,8,54,,,,,,,,
10000017,"EY resourcing and length on projects. Right now, there are 3 consultants assigned to Nashville MDC project plan smartsheet. Does this need this much staffing? - Better rolloff plan of EY consultants and then staff filling these roles. Ensuring staff takes priority on strategic decisions/projects vs. consultants -Better tell the story of a consultants role onboarding and offboarding to the organization so those within CFA Supply have a clear idea",2,4,,,,,,,,
10000018,"This is a very tough topic to tackle given the fluid dynamics we've seen in the industry driven in large by CV, supply chain disruption & growing demand.  With that said, network strategy formulation & decisions seem to be disjointed; guiding information/analysis seems to have gaps which leads to extended development window, too many iterations/options to whittle down in determining best course",54,25,,,,,,,,
10000020,"communication across teams, we are hiring and spreading so quickly that many times teams or individuals ultimately get missed",2,8,,,,,,,,
10000023,Network strategy.,98,,,,,,,,,
10000024,CFA Supply is continuing to improve on our network strategy and adapting to the model we would like to use. I think this is a current challenge but as we continue to scale there will be clarity around these decisions. There has been a lot of muddy water and I believe we have applied a better filter now.

10000032,Chick-fil-A Supply and CFA Inc Supply Chain could improve on collaborating. It feels like both teams operate within their own separate space and we could have more of a team mentality!,25,,,,,,,,,
10000033,"Data driven decisions:  sometimes we do data driven decision making, other times it's a gut feel.  Data should be collected, manually if necessary, around processes that need to be improved.  After an improvement is made, collect the data again and verify an improvement actually happened! Ask about automation in the warehouse: that's too expensive.  At what cost point would it not be too expensive?  No answer.",49,59,,,,,,,,
10000034,The speed of decision making can be improved.  The business is moving so fast that the planning process feels very rushed in order to plan for the growth and scale.,54,13,,,,,,,,
10000035,Organizational alignment (are we a part of CFA Inc and Supply Chain? will we always remain separate?)  Having two leaders seems confusing and I don't understand the delineation.,18,25,,,,,,,,
10000047,"The IT organizational design is confusing for Team Members. Example includes DTT ETS and entity IT co-existing vs combining into one group. Also, entity IT is made of exclusively Supply Team Members who serve both entities, but only subject to Supply incentive distributions.",53,,,,,,,,,
10000048,Not running before we can walk - Allowing us time to familiarize ourselves with systems before we start asking for enhancements. Don't ask for metrics to be part of calculations before they are even trackable/exist in the system.,98,,,,,,,,,
10000049,(More of an overall Inc. problem) but need to provide better technology / tools to host hybrid meetings in the office and have it be consistent in every room.,6,14,37,,,,,,,
10000050,Chick-fil-A needs more computer monitors at the Support Center for their employees.,98,,,,,,,,,
10000054,i think BCF needs better communication with CFA Inc. there are systems and programs that should be shared with BCF team members but cannot because of security restrictions.  Example Atrium Talks- Many BCF team members are denied access because they are not a Services employee but listed as Operations,8,,,,,,,,,

10000088,Decisions around what not to do or what to stop doing. We seem to have a hard time to say no to something.,98,,,,,,,,,
10000089,"Ability to performance-manage staff effectively.  Legal makes it nearly impossible to offboard talent that is underperforming or actually damaging the morale of the team.  We must get comfortable that as fast as we are growing, we are going to make some wrong hires or that people may even take a wrong turn in their careers and not everyone is on the right ""bus"".",2,54,27,,,,,,,

10000098,"Decisions that impact subteams within departments. While a decision at that level may have negative impacts that reach up to the broader enterprise or multi department level, these types of decisions can have strong positive impacts as well. While it is important to weigh these decisions and I respect the process, I have seen and bore witness to these type of decisions being put on hold to deal with other issues. I believe that the company loses more than it gains here. Examples are: decisions to re-level certain roles within a sub department and the decision takes over half a year to approve.",15,52,34,,,,,,,
10000099,"They need to be more consistent in staff selection.  I have seen too many examples of requiring one set of guidelines for one group, only to not require the same of all groups.

Restaurant technology decisions seem to be made too quickly - without enough testing, given the risk and impact to business operations.

Staff technology decisions seem to be made too slowly (years in some cases) - too much evaluation given the risks and impacts.",6,53,13,,,,,,,

I think there needs to be some recognition that while a fresh pair of eyes and new ideas can be wise, a learning curb slows down progress.

Career interests in workday are still being ignored, there are far too many jobs not being posted and people being moved around like pawns on a chess board.  Legacy leaders do things to people without bringing them along in their own career journey.  They lead like this is a church and people are here to serve in whatever part of the ""congregation"" where there is a need.  And then they'll say they prayed about the decision as if their relationship with God is supposed to carry weight in someone else's life.

10000603,"Over the last several years, I have seen a departure away from the sharing of the ""why"" behind the decisions that are made.  When I arrived at Chick-fil-A, there was no question that the Corporate Purpose served as our true north. It was the filter that decisions at all levels of the business passed through to ensure alignment with our collective ""why"".  As we have pursued an accelerated growth strategy over the last several years, our focus and ""why"" seems to have turned more towards sales growth and less towards stewardship and positive influence.  We observe this in every Atrium Talk and Field Talk Live where the sales results are highlighted and celebrated (because it is what we measure) but there is limited mention of the key principle we were built to accomplish...""to glorify God"".  I recognize we are a ""for profit business"", and I am proud to be a part of it.  I just think we are losing our clarity, focus and alignment on ""why"" we are working so hard to grow this business so fast, and the trade-offs that are being made as a result raises concerns.",54,13,12,,,,,,,

10000606,Little Blue Menu felt like a last minute add-on that threw a lot of departments into a tailspin and added a ton of work without any additional capacity.  The speed in which we dove head-first into that without seemingly thinking through the pitfalls and risks was unnecessary and caused a lot of headaches.  When work like this gets thrust onto departments there are necessary trade-offs that occur in order to meet the demands of the business.  My question is what possibly fell through the cracks or didn't get completed as a result of the LBM initiative?  Or did nothing fall through because we have such high performing Teams and did families suffer due to long work hours to make it happen?

For instance, we were waaaaaay too late to the game on getting rid of ties, suits for managers, and pantyhose for women, allowing men to have long hair, bears, and ear piercings, and hiring people with visible tattoos. We still don't allow non-traditional hair colors which is INSANE to me in 2021. How in the world can you say that someone's choice of hair color reflects their professionalism, and why does that even matter? Why is it ok for 50% of women in the workplace to bleach their hair blonde, destroying their hair over time, but it's not ok for someone to use purple shampoo to put a colorful tint in their hair that is perfectly healthy and doesn't fry their hair? Clothing is another one. For some reason, we say that a shirt with extra fabric around the neck and a few buttons down the sternum is ""nicer"" than a shirt that omits the fabric and buttons. This is a polo vs a t-shirt. Pants that are made out of cotton and polyester are ""nicer"" than pants made out of denim (""dress"" pants vs jeans). I understand the desire to mirror the attire in Restaurants and think that's valuable. However, the type of shirt or pants shouldn't matter. Your clothes should be clean, fit well, and free of anything offensive, and that should be the requirement. Give team members the option to wear various types of CFA shirts. Then we can mirror them and stop worrying about the type of fabric people are wearing to work. CFA's stance on appearance has been far too closely tied to traditional Southern Christian opinions which tend to judge people based on subculture stereotypes. CFA has leaned on outdated corporate norms too. We have to break out of that mindset and allow people to look and dress how they are comfortable. I'm not a collared shirt and slacks kind of guy, so in order to actually bring my full self to work, I'd need to dress like myself in  a well fitting t-shirt and clean jeans.

10002073,"CFA tends to hesitate too much when making decisions that require Staff to do things a certain way. My pre-pandemic example is technology: CFA likes to allow for several different options rather than encouraging a standard. Digital communication is one such example, letting people choose for themselves what to use instead of guiding Staff onto a single platform, leading to fragmentation. This seems to be changing recently though with the retirement of Bluejeans and its replacement of Zoom being communicated as being for external-only, but Slack is still being used heavily, Miro is now being used for collaboration, and Confluence is still for documentation. I can usually find all the information I need, but sometimes it takes a while to search each tool. The choice isn't necessarily a bad thing, but I think more clarity around what is preferred/recommended would be helpful at times. Where I've really seen this hesitancy around erring towards choice become problematic is regarding COVID-19 precautions. I'm not considering the implications for Restaurants as that's not an area I'm knowledgeable in and I know things become way more complicated for them, but as it relates to Support Center Staff in Atlanta, I've been disappointed in the recent trend for CFA only to enforce the legally mandated minimums for protecting our Staff. Earlier this year when vaccines were just rolling out, I didn't necessarily expect that CFA would go the extra mile and take actions like providing vaccines on campus or at giving incentives for Staff to get vaccinated (granted, leadership did provide verbal encouragement). It's certainly not CFA's fault that reactions to medical advice have become politicized and I'm sure if we could've known at the time how things would play out, CFA would've been more proactive from the beginning. However, in that lull before the Delta variant when mask requirements began to be lifted, CFA's deference to ?choice led to the decision of putting Staff on the honor system regarding their vaccination status and not wear a mask if they were vaccinated. Had the guidance been followed as written, the medical advice around this was solid for what we knew at the time, and I know we like to think CFA Staff are responsible. But I know for a fact many people who were unvaccinated were going around campus without a mask. I worked closely on campus for weeks with someone who never wore a mask, so I assumed they were vaccinated, but they then came down with COVID and later confessed they weren't. Was that person's choice worth the risk they put on me, other Staff, and all of our families? By avoiding making a tough decision earlier, CFA?albeit along with almost every other company and government?is now in a difficult place where the inertia of choice has picked up steam and it's difficult to change course. During the last Atrium Talk where Libby and Cliff shared that pending federal requirements would mean CFA would start recording vaccination statuses and require the unvaccinated to get tested regularly, I was extremely disappointed to see Staff commenting horrible things in reaction in the chat. Now that those regulations are in limbo, CFA appears to be backing off to whatever the new legally mandated minimum requirements will be, which I don't think should be CFA's approach to caring for our Staff. I know medical decisions are difficult legally, but if CFA can decide to require Staff to come back to the office, we can also make the decision to go the extra mile and make sure everyone will feel safe.",12,37,6,24,72,8,,,,
10002074,"While we generally hire high-quality people, I've noticed a trend of waning stewardship in newer staff when it comes to technology. There's an attitude of ""I want it and Chick-fil-A has the money"" where I feel like five years ago there was more of an attitude of saying ""do I REALLY need this?""

I think it can be frustrating for some folks because the messaging we receive is - ""X is the decision, and X is the best way that we can all care for everyone"" when even that statement may not be felt to be true by everyone. Again, I understand a lot of these types of decisions are hard to make and I'm not criticizing any of them specifically per se, but I get the general air that some people feel that their concerns and desires are being washed over in the name of an abstract concept like ""care"".

But the reality is, many teams have had to hire people within their teams to keep up with the demand for Int'l with very little strategy shared and LOTS of wasted time with lack of communication on decisions and what decisions mean or after a decision was made, individual teams had to make a lot of changes to meet that decision/expectation (causing lots of stress and misaligned priorities for cross-functional work).

It has made me not share honest feedback because I've seen that every time that happens, leadership will do the opposite of what people recommend.

They don't let their people grow because they don't hire people who actually learn their role so all the work that people don't know and can't/aren't willing to do falls on the select few people who are actually wanting to work, learn, and grow. It is baffling that L&D leadership just ignores this issue and doesn't see it. Most of the extremely talented Learning Partners on the Learning Partner team have moved to different departments and L&D leadership says it's because the L&D department has helped them with their career goals, but for many of them, it's actually because the L&D department leadership doesn't reward their good work by helping them move around within the L&D department.

They saw an incredible marketing and customer experience opportunity to capitalize on, and were able to rally a large team to make it happen in less than two days. While the vast majority of decisions can't be made that way, and there were many who were hesitant stating there could be some backfire from moving so quickly, Joe said something to the effect of ""I hear the concerns, but in thinking through how incredibly minor the risks are for this type of short term offer we're going to do this bc it's a chance to really quickly inject some fun into Chick-fil-A.""

From the first introduction of Total Rewards, there were changes made that did seem to improve the initial leveling/total rewards.  I still believe, however, that there are some glaring inconsistencies across the business. While I am very grateful for Chick-fil-A's care in compensation, inconsistencies have a negative impact on morale and culture. For instance, when the new structure was initially implemented, I was placed at one level. I felt it was wrong as did my people leader. A year later, that leveling was changed. It was explicitly explained to me that this was not a promotion, but a ""correction"" as they did agree my leveling was errant to begin with. What was never acknowledged or addressed, however, was the fact that, after a year of working at what was conceded as an incorrect level, the adjustment never came with any back compensation. I would just assume have been granted a promotion with no back compensation, but given that I was explicitly told it was a correction, back compensation would've made sense.  As I said, I am grateful for the correction in leveling. I'm grateful for the many ways Chick-fil-A takes care of me. I did not even bring the back compensation up at the time though, lest it be construed as me being ungrateful and a perpetual black mark on my reputation.  Further, on total rewards, we were told that the levels would provide a standard way to gauge work and that it would be consistent to the job, not the individual. I applaud that decision HOWEVER, in recent moves, I know of two individuals moving to new roles in which they were one if not two levels lower than their predecessor in those roles. There may be a reason for this, but the explanation of the decision was missing and leaves staff feeling as though Total Rewards is still a black box into which we have very little understanding.",3,20,23,5,57,,,,,

10000872,"More and more companies are allowing employees to live elsewhere and work from home full time. The new generation graduating from college is expecting this to be an option, especially in larger companies. Personally, my family would not chose Atlanta for a variety of reasons and are only living here for Chick-fil-A. If given the option we would move to another state, closer to family members which would incredibly enrich our lives and the lives of our kids. With the current requirement of ""avg 10 days/month and for big events"" this still doesn't easily allow for us to live elsewhere full time. I am hopeful that Chick-fil-A eventually allows this option to better align with today's work environment expectations and to allow employees to truly love where they live.",38,,,,,,,,,

For example, a contingent worker brought on for 6 months to a year to help with app development will likely only perform development work, for example writing code. They may end up producing an application or part of it, but in the process they didn't document any of their work, since it was a requirement, or if it was it wasn't enforced and built into their project schedule. This lack of ""depth of work"" produces tools and technologies that can become quickly outdated and/or a burden for the company to use and manage.",6,13,,,,,,,,
