Cross Company Visibility  Currently we just have transparency in departments and not across the organization. Creating silos and lack of a corporate roadmap and milestone to be easily seen.  Central Communication Sharing  One source of truth across the organization for sharing requirements input and updates. Ex. SMEs across the organization can easily see and contribute to what individual teams are working on. Currently WHED SMEs get updates through emails or calls, one tool could give them a chance for asynchronous insight and feedback.  Central Documentation  Get documentation out of emails. One tool would allow a one stop shop for anyone to go to when looking for documentation, requirements, links, etc.   Inter-department Dependencies Tracking  Ex. L&D is working with DTT on requirements, using 2 different tools doesn't allow for work to be shared, dependencies to be tracked, or scope to be easily reviewed.  Decrease Ramp Up Time  Ex.

The Director of our team was not asked about what exactly everyone on the team does day in and day out, the impacts, influence of the roles, etc. This has caused issues not just for our team but others across the business. For our team there were several consequences. Several on the team did not feel their work was properly 'honored' by the organization. There was a lot time wasted by the leadership team as we followed the proper channels to pushback on the leveling. Lastly, the leveling made it difficult to attract the right level talent to our team from across the organization.

Our team had a fantastic contractor who was trying to find a Staff role so that he could stay. He mentioned that he applied for 7 or 8 different positions here and none of them worked out.  In addition, I would like to be able to recommend positions to friends, but every time that I have checked the public portal for Corporate job listings in the last year, the page of entry-level positions has been empty (with maybe one or two exceptions for roles that are in a separate department).

My pre-pandemic example is technology: CFA likes to allow for several different options rather than encouraging a standard. Digital communication is one such example, letting people choose for themselves what to use instead of guiding Staff onto a single platform, leading to fragmentation. This seems to be changing recently though with the retirement of Bluejeans and its replacement of Zoom being communicated as being for external-only, but Slack is still being used heavily, Miro is now being used for collaboration, and Confluence is still for documentation. I can usually find all the information I need, but sometimes it takes a while to search each tool. The choice isn't necessarily a bad thing, but I think more clarity around what is preferred/recommended would be helpful at times. Where I've really seen this hesitancy around erring towards choice become problematic is regarding COVID-19 precautions. I'm not considering the implications for Restaurants as that's not an area I'm knowledgeable in and I know things become way more complicated for them, but as it relates to Support Center Staff in Atlanta, I've been disappointed in the recent trend for CFA only to enforce the legally mandated minimums for protecting our Staff. Earlier this year when vaccines were just rolling out, I didn't necessarily expect that CFA would go the extra mile and take actions like providing vaccines on campus or at giving incentives for Staff to get vaccinated (granted, leadership did provide verbal encouragement). It's certainly not CFA's fault that reactions to medical advice have become politicized and I'm sure if we could've known at the time how things would play out, CFA would've been more proactive from the beginning. However, in that lull before the Delta variant when mask requirements began to be lifted, CFA's deference to ?choice led to the decision of putting Staff on the honor system regarding their vaccination status and not wear a mask if they were vaccinated. Had the guidance been followed as written, the medical advice around this was solid for what we knew at the time, and I know we like to think CFA Staff are responsible. But I know for a fact many people who were unvaccinated were going around campus without a mask. I worked closely on campus for weeks with someone who never wore a mask, so I assumed they were vaccinated, but they then came down with COVID and later confessed they weren't. Was that person's choice worth the risk they put on me, other Staff, and all of our families? By avoiding making a tough decision earlier, CFA?albeit along with almost every other company and government?is now in a difficult place where the inertia of choice has picked up steam and it's difficult to change course. During the last Atrium Talk where Libby and Cliff shared that pending federal requirements would mean CFA would start recording vaccination statuses and require the unvaccinated to get tested regularly, I was extremely disappointed to see Staff commenting horrible things in reaction in the chat. Now that those regulations are in limbo, CFA appears to be backing off to whatever the new legally mandated minimum requirements will be, which I don't think should be CFA's approach to caring for our Staff. I know medical decisions are difficult legally, but if CFA can decide to require Staff to come back to the office, we can also make the decision to go the extra mile and make sure everyone will feel safe.",6

1948,"Decisions are often held up at the highest level and often changed from leadership even if they approve something early, they often come in and change their decision later in the timeline not always for changing business needs but they have changed their opinion. The type of decisions leadership gets in on many times is too granular.  Most of the the time the leader isn't the SME and trumps the decision of the SME and they should be trusting their people. Leadership should be pressure testing and challenging but at CFA leaders make most of the decisions.  When people are assigned as the owning the decision, they often are just waiting for someone to come in a change it - it is almost expected for something to change than not to change. It feels like no one owns decisions unless they are officers or above. And Officers are often 4/5 layers away from the work that they are making decisions on.  They might have done that work 10 years ago but there are people doing that work now, that we hired to do that work, let them do the work and leadership should want to make their work better, not harder. I don't often think that is the frame our leaders are using.",70

The ones I am thinking of have nothing to do with my work/department, but some of the moves I have seen have been very surprising to me based on my past interactions and work with some people, and I have heard more about this from other people over the past few years than I ever heard in my entire time at Chick-fil-A. My concern is two-fold: 1) that some of the people leading other people and/or work are not the best people for the job, which could result in outcomes that are not as good as what could be, and 2) that some high-performing staff members will become discouraged/disgruntled/disillusioned over time and lose focus or reduce their efforts.",70

I've watched my mentors who are pioneers in the learning industry get shot down multiple times and it's incredibly discouraging. It has made me not share honest feedback because I've seen that every time that happens, leadership will do the opposite of what people recommend. I've always thought that they had their reasons that I'm just not seeing, but now that I've seen them use multiple people multiple times because those people are good at their jobs and then keep them stuck in their same positions with the only reason of ""you're the only one who knows the content"", is absurd to me. They don't let their people grow because they don't hire people who actually learn their role so all the work that people don't know and can't/aren't willing to do falls on the select few people who are actually wanting to work, learn, and grow. It is baffling that L&D leadership just ignores this issue and doesn't see it. Most of the extremely talented Learning Partners on the Learning Partner team have moved to different departments and L&D leadership says it's because the L&D department has helped them with their career goals, but for many of them, it's actually because the L&D department leadership doesn't reward their good work by helping them move around within the L&D department. I would love for my career to grow in learning because that's what I want to do, but if I want to grow and learn at Chick-fil-A, I'm realizing that I will probably need to look outside of the L&D department.",3

This creates a massive technical debt, encourages unnecessary risk, and promotes antiquated practices that are sometimes decades behind what DTT offers today. Other departments need to trust DTT to support their technology needs, and DTT needs the business to support that partnership.",6
2958,It is difficult to not see the Total Rewards and Talent management at CFA to be a little bit inconsistent and vague. I know a lot of effort has been made to improve this over the years but there is still a lot of inconsistency across the organization. For example a role that is a level 10 in one department might be a 12 in another. Both really seem to be very similar work and Total Rewards might find them two levels apart. I don't mean to target Total Rewards but I believe more consistency could be achieved.,2

2981,"Total Rewards. As I understand it, that team has a tremendous amount of responsibility. I do not envy them or presume the decisions are made lightly. From the first introduction of Total Rewards, there were changes made that did seem to improve the initial leveling/total rewards.  I still believe, however, that there are some glaring inconsistencies across the business. While I am very grateful for Chick-fil-A's care in compensation, inconsistencies have a negative impact on morale and culture. For instance, when the new structure was initially implemented, I was placed at one level. I felt it was wrong as did my people leader. A year later, that leveling was changed. It was explicitly explained to me that this was not a promotion, but a ""correction"" as they did agree my leveling was errant to begin with. What was never acknowledged or addressed, however, was the fact that, after a year of working at what was conceded as an incorrect level, the adjustment never came with any back compensation. I would just assume have been granted a promotion with no back compensation, but given that I was explicitly told it was a correction, back compensation would've made sense.  As I said, I am grateful for the correction in leveling. I'm grateful for the many ways Chick-fil-A takes care of me. I did not even bring the back compensation up at the time though, lest it be construed as me being ungrateful and a perpetual black mark on my reputation.  Further, on total rewards, we were told that the levels would provide a standard way to gauge work and that it would be consistent to the job, not the individual. I applaud that decision HOWEVER, in recent moves, I know of two individuals moving to new roles in which they were one if not two levels lower than their predecessor in those roles. There may be a reason for this, but the explanation of the decision was missing and leaves staff feeling as though Total Rewards is still a black box into which we have very little understanding.",3
