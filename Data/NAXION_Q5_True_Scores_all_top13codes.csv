Central Communication Sharing  One source of truth across the organization for sharing requirements input and updates. Ex.

One tool would allow a one stop shop for anyone to go to when looking for documentation, requirements, links, etc.   Inter-department Dependencies Tracking  Ex. L&D is working with DTT on requirements, using 2 different tools doesn't allow for work to be shared, dependencies to be tracked, or scope to be easily reviewed.  Decrease Ramp Up Time  Ex.

We still don't allow non-traditional hair colors which is INSANE to me in 2021. How in the world can you say that someone's choice of hair color reflects their professionalism, and why does that even matter? Why is it ok for 50% of women in the workplace to bleach their hair blonde, destroying their hair over time, but it's not ok for someone to use purple shampoo to put a colorful tint in their hair that is perfectly healthy and doesn't fry their hair? Clothing is another one. For some reason, we say that a shirt with extra fabric around the neck and a few buttons down the sternum is ""nicer"" than a shirt that omits the fabric and buttons. This is a polo vs a t-shirt. Pants that are made out of cotton and polyester are ""nicer"" than pants made out of denim (""dress"" pants vs jeans). I understand the desire to mirror the attire in Restaurants and think that's valuable. However, the type of shirt or pants shouldn't matter. Your clothes should be clean, fit well, and free of anything offensive, and that should be the requirement. Give team members the option to wear various types of CFA shirts. Then we can mirror them and stop worrying about the type of fabric people are wearing to work. CFA's stance on appearance has been far too closely tied to traditional Southern Christian opinions which tend to judge people based on subculture stereotypes. CFA has leaned on outdated corporate norms too. We have to break out of that mindset and allow people to look and dress how they are comfortable.

1330,10002073,"CFA tends to hesitate too much when making decisions that require Staff to do things a certain way. My pre-pandemic example is technology: CFA likes to allow for several different options rather than encouraging a standard. Digital communication is one such example, letting people choose for themselves what to use instead of guiding Staff onto a single platform, leading to fragmentation. This seems to be changing recently though with the retirement of Bluejeans and its replacement of Zoom being communicated as being for external-only, but Slack is still being used heavily, Miro is now being used for collaboration, and Confluence is still for documentation. I can usually find all the information I need, but sometimes it takes a while to search each tool. The choice isn't necessarily a bad thing, but I think more clarity around what is preferred/recommended would be helpful at times. Where I've really seen this hesitancy around erring towards choice become problematic is regarding COVID-19 precautions. I'm not considering the implications for Restaurants as that's not an area I'm knowledgeable in and I know things become way more complicated for them, but as it relates to Support Center Staff in Atlanta, I've been disappointed in the recent trend for CFA only to enforce the legally mandated minimums for protecting our Staff. Earlier this year when vaccines were just rolling out, I didn't necessarily expect that CFA would go the extra mile and take actions like providing vaccines on campus or at giving incentives for Staff to get vaccinated (granted, leadership did provide verbal encouragement). It's certainly not CFA's fault that reactions to medical advice have become politicized and I'm sure if we could've known at the time how things would play out, CFA would've been more proactive from the beginning. However, in that lull before the Delta variant when mask requirements began to be lifted, CFA's deference to ?choice led to the decision of putting Staff on the honor system regarding their vaccination status and not wear a mask if they were vaccinated. Had the guidance been followed as written, the medical advice around this was solid for what we knew at the time, and I know we like to think CFA Staff are responsible. But I know for a fact many people who were unvaccinated were going around campus without a mask. I worked closely on campus for weeks with someone who never wore a mask, so I assumed they were vaccinated, but they then came down with COVID and later confessed they weren't. Was that person's choice worth the risk they put on me, other Staff, and all of our families? By avoiding making a tough decision earlier, CFA?albeit along with almost every other company and government?is now in a difficult place where the inertia of choice has picked up steam and it's difficult to change course. During the last Atrium Talk where Libby and Cliff shared that pending federal requirements would mean CFA would start recording vaccination statuses and require the unvaccinated to get tested regularly, I was extremely disappointed to see Staff commenting horrible things in reaction in the chat. Now that those regulations are in limbo, CFA appears to be backing off to whatever the new legally mandated minimum requirements will be, which I don't think should be CFA's approach to caring for our Staff. I know medical decisions are difficult legally, but if CFA can decide to require Staff to come back to the office, we can also make the decision to go the extra mile and make sure everyone will feel safe.",12,37,6,24,72,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0

From the first introduction of Total Rewards, there were changes made that did seem to improve the initial leveling/total rewards.  I still believe, however, that there are some glaring inconsistencies across the business. While I am very grateful for Chick-fil-A's care in compensation, inconsistencies have a negative impact on morale and culture. For instance, when the new structure was initially implemented, I was placed at one level. I felt it was wrong as did my people leader. A year later, that leveling was changed. It was explicitly explained to me that this was not a promotion, but a ""correction"" as they did agree my leveling was errant to begin with. What was never acknowledged or addressed, however, was the fact that, after a year of working at what was conceded as an incorrect level, the adjustment never came with any back compensation. I would just assume have been granted a promotion with no back compensation, but given that I was explicitly told it was a correction, back compensation would've made sense.  As I said, I am grateful for the correction in leveling. I'm grateful for the many ways Chick-fil-A takes care of me. I did not even bring the back compensation up at the time though, lest it be construed as me being ungrateful and a perpetual black mark on my reputation.  Further, on total rewards, we were told that the levels would provide a standard way to gauge work and that it would be consistent to the job, not the individual. I applaud that decision HOWEVER, in recent moves, I know of two individuals moving to new roles in which they were one if not two levels lower than their predecessor in those roles. There may be a reason for this, but the explanation of the decision was missing and leaves staff feeling as though Total Rewards is still a black box into which we have very little understanding.",3,20,23,5,57,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
